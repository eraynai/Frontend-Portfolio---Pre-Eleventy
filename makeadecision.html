            <p>
              How To Make A Decision was a project that I completed for an interactive video class that I took in the fall of 2020.  The goal of the assignment was to create an interactive e-learning tutorial which was highly engaging for the user.</p>

                <p>As this was a solo project, I worked on all aspects of the production including scripting, storyboarding, shooting, editing, and delivery.</p>

            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <p>Due to the fact that this class took place during the height of the pandemic, I had to be be very creative with my execution as I was limited with my options for filming the project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-me-3 description-about">
            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>I decided to use motion capture through a VR app called Flipside Studio.  This creative thinking allowed me the opportunity to generate a video of high production value using minimal resources under very tight budget and time constraints.</p>

        <div class="text-me-3 description-about">
            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>I looked at different e-learning experiences and tried to differentiate the aspects that made them special from the competition.  What I discovered was because of the saturation in the market, teachers needed to find a way to differentiate their content from other e-learning creators. As a result, I tried to utilize a sense of humor in my experience so that people would naturally want to keep engaging with it.</p>

        <div class="text-me-3 description-about">
            <h1>User Flow</h1>
            <p>I created a user flow of how the user could engage with the content and because the narrative was branching, at which points the user would have agency to change the experience.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Over the course of this project I applied many problem solving skills to create an e-learning that was of high production value.  I wanted to create something that people don't typically see in the e-learning space and based on the small sample of feedback that I received, it was a very successful and effective approach.</p>

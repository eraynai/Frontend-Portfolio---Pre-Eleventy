            <p>
              Nourish is a motivational AR experience built for the Snapchat
              mobile platform. The project was made over a 4 week period
              starting in October 2020 when our team was accepted into the AR
              residency. The purpose of the project was to create a lens that
              would help people to initiate or maintain healthy habits.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the end of this residency I became an
              <strong>Official Lens Creator with Snap</strong>.

              As the creative lead and one of the designers, I worked in
              collaboration with another designer to create assets, train the
              machine learning model, and program interactions in the Snapchat
              lens.

          <h1>Challenge</h1>
          <p>
            During the pandemic lockdowns we were all feeling isolated,
            unmotivated and lonely. We wanted to offer an AR experience that can
            be motivational and uplifting during these hard times.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project faced numerous challenges throughout the design &
            production process including time, resources, and a limited
            knowledge of how to use the required software to assemble and create
            interactions within the experience. In addition, as neither of us on
            the team were character animators. We had to find a technical
            solution of how we were going make the custom movements that we
            wanted the Nourish characters to make.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional constraint that we faced was the final size of the
            lens could be no larger than 4MB. As a result, we had to limit how
            many 3D characters we were going to create.

            <strong>Nourish</strong> is a motivational lens that encourages you
            to stay healthy both mentally and physically.
          </p>

          <p>
            The way that the lens works is the user is able to scan three
            separate objects in their environment -
            <strong>pillow, bowl, and running shoes</strong>. Once the camera
            recognizes them, the characters appear and form a motivational word
            and then dance before disappearing. The words we chose were "Rise",
            "Run", and "Sense".

            We thought of different ways to motivate people, but the lens didn't
            really take shape until we landed on this idea that these characters
            are always with you and you just need to scan specific items that
            exist in your personal space to bring them out.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order for the lens to know your environment we needed to use ML
            model so the lens could identify specific items that we chose for
            the design.

          <p>
            We created various wireframes so that we could visualize the flow of
            the lens as we wanted the experience to be as intuitive as possible
            as we knew that we only had a few seconds to capture the user's
            attention.

          <p>
            Over the course of this project I applied many problem solving
            skills to create the design and user experience of the lens. We
            aimed to create something that move beyond face filters, which is
            typically how most mobile users use Snapchat. We wanted to create a
            meaningful experience that could help people during times when they
            aren't feeling motivated to maintain a healthy lifestyle and make
            them feel they are never alone on this journey.

                <p>Nourish is a group of characters that can be found in everyday common items and come alive in the the snap filter lens.</p>
                <p>They emerge behind your pillows, running shoes, or even from your plates and are there to remind us of our full potential and help us achieve healthy habits as well as maintain strong mental health.</p>
